An important aspect of drive and intention is to never give room for spacing thoughts. dont give it time to grow, dont feed it. just keep doing. no matter what. Treat every moment as new. 
Also everything is conditional. That's where intelligence comes in.

Had an amazing discussion with my Linear Algebra course TA about to complete PHD Shiva Shankar who is the best math explainer i've ever come across. the amount of enthusiasm, understanding and passion that goes into the explaining is just amazing. Got an intuitive understanding of different elements of linal, spectral theorem, invariants and the subject of mathematics itself about which i'll be writing a detailed technical blog. 
Am supposed to work on NVG, Kuramoto and Acads syllabus understanding coverage as top priority this long weekend.  

Also currently i'm reading the book "Wings of Fire" by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam!
