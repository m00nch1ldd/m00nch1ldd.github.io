# Hello world

This is my personal blog. woohoo!!

Finally. After 2 full years of the 'want to do things' cycle, i've finally sat down today to setup my blog on github pages where i hope to post everyday about something i learn, in a way to track my progress in things and also exploring the sea of STEM, art(poetry+music), spirituality and some learnings and practical aspects of productivity.
