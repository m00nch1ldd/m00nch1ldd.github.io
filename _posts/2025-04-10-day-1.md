# Hello world

This is my personal blog. woohoo!!

Finally. After 2 full years of the 'want to do things' cycle, i've finally sat down today to setup my blog on github pages where i hope to post everyday about something i learn, in a way to track my progress in things and also exploring the sea of STEM, art(poetry+music), spirituality and some learnings and practical aspects of productivity. A journey towards 'flow'.

Mornings are so beautiful. Birdwatching, sunrise, water sprinklers on the green lawns of Watsa, fresh green leaves of spring. Started my day with 10 rounds of jogging around Watsa with Jayesh. 

The concepts of Intention and Sticking to the decisions we make are so powerful.
Things require time, but as you keep doing things will get done.

Today i used git, configured a jekyll+ruby template for github pages, and now have deployed it and posted my first blog post! Almost took the entire day, but worth it!
In the upcoming days writing the blog will be a breeze :D

Key is to believe in the self, remember the inner child, the universe that's with you, wonder, music, love, light, and keep going. Keep doing!! You got this :D
